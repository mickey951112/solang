Contributing
============

Solang is in active development, so there are many ways in which you can
contribute.

Target Specific Tests
---------------------

Solang supports Substrate, Burrow and ewasm. All these targets need testing
via integration tests. New targets like
`Farbic <https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-chaincode-wasm>`_ and
`Sawtooth Sabre <https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sabre>`_ need to be
added, and tests added.

How to report issues
--------------------

Please report issues to
`github issues <https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang/issues>`_.
