Installing Solang
=================

The Solang compiler is a single binary. It can be installed in many different
ways, so please pick whichever method suits your needs.

Using hyperledgerlabs/solang docker hub images
----------------------------------------------

New images are automatically made available on
`docker hub <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hyperledgerlabs/solang/>`_. Simply pull the latest docker image using:

.. code-block:: bash

	docker pull hyperledgerlabs/solang

And if you are using podman:

.. code-block:: bash

	podman image pull hyperlederlabs/solang

The solang binary is in ``/usr/bin/solang`` in this image. The latest tag
gets updated each time there is a commit to the master branch of the solang
git repository.

Build Solang from source using Dockerfile
-----------------------------------------

First clone the git repo using:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang

Then you can build the image using:

.. code-block:: bash

	docker build .

Alternatively this will work with podman too:

.. code-block:: bash

	podman image build .

Building Solang from source from crates.io
------------------------------------------

Solang is listed on `crates.io <https://crates.io/crates/solang>`_. Only
releases are pushed to cargo, and the current release is out of date. This is
how you tell cargo to retrieve the latest version of solang and compile it
from source:

.. code-block:: bash

	cargo install solang

You will need the llvm libraries for this to work, see
`Installing the LLVM Libraries`_.

Building Solang from source
---------------------------
In order to build solang from source, you will need rust 1.40.0 or higher,
and llvm version 8 or higher with the WebAssembly target enabled.

So see if you have the correct version of rust, simply execute:

.. code-block:: bash

  rustc --version

If you do not have the correct version of rust installed, go to `rustup <https://rustup.rs/>`_.

After making sure llvm and rust are installed, just run:

.. code-block:: bash

  cargo build --release

The executable will be in ``target/release/solang``.

Verify that you have the LLVM Libraries installed
-------------------------------------------------

To make sure you have the correct version of the llvm libraries installed, first run:

.. code-block:: bash

  llvm-config --version

The output should be 8.0 or higher. Then check if the WebAssembly target is enabled by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  llc --version

You should see wasm32 listed under the targets. Lastly check that the static libraries are installed:

.. code-block:: bash

  llvm-config --link-static --libs

If there is no output, there are no static llvm libraries and building will fail.

Installing the LLVM Libraries
-----------------------------
If you do not have the llvm libraries installed then you can either install
your distribution llvm packages or compile your own. Compiling your own is helpful
if you want to do solang development.

Any release from llvm 8.0 onwards, with the WebAssembly target enabled should work.
Note that you will also need clang; the Solidity standard library is written in C,
and is compiled to wasm by clang. The version of clang *must* be the same as the version of llvm.


Installing LLVM on Ubuntu
_________________________

You will need ubuntu 18.04 with backports or later. Just run:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo apt install curl llvm-8-dev clang-8 git zlib1g-dev cargo

Installing LLVM on Fedora
_________________________

You will need Fedora 30 or later. Running the following:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo dnf install cargo llvm8.0-static llvm8.0-devel zlib-devel clang libffi-devel

Installing LLVM from source
___________________________

If your system does not come with llvm, then you have to build your own.
Building your own llvm libraries does not interfere with any llvm libraries
installed by your distribution.

The llvm project is a large code base so it will take some time to build.

If you are planning to do development on Solang itself, then having your
own built llvm is helpful. The distributions build llvm without
assertions enabled. These assertions check that the LLVM IR that Solang builds
is correct. If the LLVM IR is not correct, then faults might happen when llvm
runs compiler passes on the LLVM IR and the stack trace will not be useful
to debug it.

The llvm project itself has a guide to `installing from source <http://www.llvm.org/docs/CMake.html>`_ which you may need to consult.
First if all clone the llvm repository:

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project
	cd llvm-project

Now switch to the 8.0 release branch:

.. code-block:: bash

	git checkout -b release_8.x origin/release/8.x

Ensure that clang will built:

.. code-block:: bash

	ln -s ../../clang llvm/tools/clang

Create a directory where the build and intermediate files will be stored:

.. code-block:: bash

	mkdir build
	cd build

Now run cmake to create the makefiles. Replace the *installdir* argument to ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` with with a directory where you would like to have llvm installed, and then run the build:

.. code-block:: bash

	cmake -G Ninja -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=WebAssembly -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=On \
		-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=installdir ../llvm
	cmake --build . --target install

Once the build has succeeded, the *installdir*/bin has to be added to your path so the
Solang build can find the ``llvm-config`` from this build:

.. code-block:: bash

	export PATH=installdir/bin:$PATH
