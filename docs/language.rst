Solidity Language
=================

The Solidity language supported by Solang is compatible with the
`Ethereum Foundation Solidity Compiler <https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/>`_ with
these caveats:

- At this point Solang is very much a work in progress; not all features are
  supported yet.

- Solang can target different blockchains and some features depending on the target.
  For example, Parity Substrate uses a different ABI encoding and allows constructors
  to be overloaded.

- Solang generates WebAssembly rather than EVM. This means that the ``assembly {}``
  statement using EVM instructions is not supported, and probably never will be.

.. note::

  Where differences exist between different targets or the Ethereum Foundation Solidity
  compiler, this is noted in boxes like these.

Solidity Source File Structure
------------------------------

A Solidity source file may have multiple contracts in them. A contract is defined
with the ``contract`` keyword, following by the contract name and then the definition
of the contract in curly braces ``{ }``. Multiple contracts maybe defined in one solidity
source file. The name of the contract does not have to match the name of the file,
although it this might be convenient.

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract A {
      /// foo simply returns true
      function foo() public return (bool) {
          return true;
      }
  }

  contract B {
      /// bar simply returns false
      function bar() public return (bool) {
          return false;
      }
  }

When compiling this, Solang will output ``A.wasm`` and ``B.wasm``, along with the ABI
files for each contract.

Pragmas
_______

Often, Solidity source files start with a ``pragma solidity`` which specifies the Ethereum
Foundation Solidity compiler version which is permitted to compile this code. Solang does
not follow the Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler version numbering scheme, so these
pragma statements are silently ignored. There is no need for a ``pragma solidity`` statement
when using Solang.

.. code-block:: javascript

    pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.4.8;
    pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

The `ABIEncoderV2` pragma is not needed with Solang; structures can always be ABI encoded or
decoded. All other pragma statements are ignored, but generate warnings. A pragma must be
terminated with a semicolon.

.. note::

    The Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler can also contain elements other than contracts and
    pragmas: ``import``, ``library``, ``interface``. These are not supported yet.

Types
-----

The following primitive types are supported.

Boolean Type
____________

``bool``
  This represents a single value which can be either ``true`` or ``false``.

Integer Types
_____________

``uint``
  This represents a single unsigned integer of 256 bits wide. Values can be for example
  ``0``, ``102``, ``0xdeadcafe``, or ``1000_000_000_000_000``.

``uint64``, ``uint32``, ``uint16``, ``uint8``
  These represent shorter single unsigned integers of the given width. These widths are
  most efficient in WebAssembly and should be used whenever possible.

``uintN``
  These represent shorter single unsigned integers of width ``N``. ``N`` can be anything
  between 8 and 256 bits and a multiple of 8, e.g. ``uint24``.

``int``
  This represents a single signed integer of 256 bits wide. Values can be for example
  ``-102``, ``0``, ``102`` or ``-0xdead_cafe``.

``int64``, ``uint32``, ``uint16``, ``uint8``
  These represent shorter single signed integers of the given width. These widths are
  most efficient in WebAssembly and should be used whenever possible.

``intN``
  These represent shorter single signed integers of width ``N``. ``N`` can be anything
  between 8 and 256 bits and a multiple of 8, e.g. ``int128``.

Underscores ``_`` are allowed in numbers, as long as the number does not start with
an underscore. This means that ``1_000`` is allowed but ``_1000`` is not. Similarly
``0xffff_0000`` is fine, but ``0x_f`` is not.

Assigning values which cannot fit into the type gives a compiler error. For example::

    uint8 foo = 300;

The largest value an ``uint8`` can hold is (2 :superscript:`8`) - 1 = 255. So, the compiler says:

.. code-block:: none

    implicit conversion would truncate from uint16 to uint8


.. tip::

  When using integers, whenever possible use the ``int64``, ``int32`` or ``uint64``,
  ``uint32`` types.

  The Solidity language has its origins for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which has
  support for 256 bit arithmetic. Most common CPUs like x86_64 do not implement arithmetic
  for such large types, and any EVM virtual machine implementation has to do bigint
  calculations, which are expensive.

  WebAssembly does not support this. This means that Solang has to emulate larger types with
  many WebAssembly instructions, resulting in larger contract code and higher gas cost.

Fixed Length byte arrays
________________________

Solidity has a primitive type unique to the language. It is a fixed-length byte array of 1 to 32
bytes, declared with *bytes* followed by the array length, for example:
``bytes32``, ``bytes24``, ``bytes8``, or ``bytes1``. ``byte`` is an alias for ``byte1``, so
``byte`` is an array of 1 element. The arrays can be initialized with either a hex string or
a text string.

.. code-block:: javascript

  bytes4 foo = "ABCD";
  bytes4 bar = hex"41_42_43_44";

The ascii value for ``A`` is 41, when written in hexadecimal. So, in this case, foo and bar
are initialized to the same value. Underscores are allowed in hex strings; they exist for
readability. If the string is shorter than the type, it is padded with zeros. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

  bytes6 foo = "AB" "CD";
  bytes5 bar = hex"41";

String literals can be concatenated like they can in C or C++. Here the types are longer than
the initializers; this means they are padded at the end with zeros. foo will contain the following
bytes in hexadecimal ``41 42 43 44 00 00`` and bar will be ``41 00 00 00 00``.

These types can be used with all the bitwise operators, ``~``, ``|``, ``&``, ``^``, ``<<``, and
``>>``. When these operators are used, the type behaves like an unsigned integer type. In this case
think the type not as an array but as a long number. For example, it is possible to shift by one bit:

.. code-block:: javascript

  bytes2 foo = hex"0101" << 1;
  // foo is 02 02

Since this is an array type, it is possible to read array elements too. They are indexed from zero.
It is not permitted to set array elements; the value of a bytesN type can only be changed
by setting the entire array value.

.. code-block:: javascript

  bytes6 wake_code = "heotymeo";
  bytes1 second_letter = wake_code[1]; // second_letter is "e"

The length can be read using the ``.length`` member variable. Since this is a fixed size array, this
is always the length of the type itself.

.. code-block:: javascript

  bytes32 hash;
  assert(hash.length == 32);
  byte b;
  assert(b.length == 1);

Address and Address Payable Type
________________________________

The ``address`` type holds the address of an account. The length of an ``address`` type depends on
the target being compiled for. On ewasm, an address is 20 bytes. Substrate has an address length
of 32 bytes. It can be initialized with a particular
hexadecimal number, called an address literal. Here is an example on ewasm:

.. code-block:: javascript

  address foo = 0xE9430d8C01C4E4Bb33E44fd7748942085D82fC91;

The hexadecimal string has to have 40 characters, and not contain any underscores.
The capitalization, i.e. whether ``a`` to ``f`` values are capitalized, is important.
It is defined in
`EIP-55 <https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md>`_. For example,
when compiling:

.. code-block:: javascript

  address foo = 0xe9430d8C01C4E4Bb33E44fd7748942085D82fC91;

Since the hexadecimal string is 40 characters without underscores, and the string does
not match the EIP-55 encoding, the compiler will refused to compile this. To make this
a regular hexadecimal number, not an address, add some leading zeros or some underscores.
To make this an address, the compiler error message will give the correct capitalization:

.. code-block:: none

  error: address literal has incorrect checksum, expected ‘0xE9430d8C01C4E4Bb33E44fd7748942085D82fC91’

An address can be payable or not. An payable address can used with the ``.send()``, ``.transfer()``, and
``selfdestruct()`` function. A non-payable address or contract can be cast to an ``address payable``
using the ``payable()`` cast, like so:

.. code-block:: javascript

    address payable addr = payable(this);

``address`` cannot be used in any arithmetic or bitwise operations. However, it can be cast to and from
bytes types and integer types and ``==`` and ``!=`` works for comparing two address types.

.. code-block:: javascript

  address foo = address(0);

.. note::
    The type name ``address payable`` cannot be used as a cast in the Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler,
    and the cast must be ``payable`` instead. This is
    `apparently due to a limitation in their parser <https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4926#discussion_r216586365>`_.
    Solang's generated parser has no such limitation and allows ``address payable`` to be used as a cast,
    but allows ``payable`` to be used as a cast well, for compatibility reasons.

.. note::

    Substrate can be built with a different type for Address. If you need support for
    a different length than the default, please get in touch.

Enums
_____

Solidity enums types need to have a definition which lists the possible values it can hold. An enum
has a type name, and a list of unique values. Enum types can used in public functions, but the value
is represented as a ``uint8`` in the ABI.

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract enum_example {
      enum Weekday { Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday }

      function is_weekend(Weekday day) public pure returns (bool) {
          return (day == Weekday.Saturday || day == Weekday.Sunday);
      }
  }

An enum can be converted to and from integer, but this requires an explicit cast. The value of an enum
is numbered from 0, like in C and Rust.

If enum is declared in another contract, it can be refered to with the `contractname.` prefix. The enum
declaration does not have to appear in a contract, in which case it can be used without the contract name
prefix in every contract.

.. code-block:: javascript

    enum planets { Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune }

    contract timeofday {
        enum time { Night, Day, Dawn, Dusk }
    }

    contract stargazing {
        function look_for(timeofday.time when) public returns (planets[]) {
            if (when == timeofday.time.Dawn || when == timeofday.time.Dusk) {
                planets[] x = new planets[](2);
                x[0] = planets.Mercury;
                x[1] = planets.Venus;
                return x;
            } else if (when == timeofday.time.Night) {
                planets[] x = new planets[](5);
                x[0] = planets.Mars;
                x[1] = planets.Jupiter;
                x[2] = planets.Saturn;
                x[3] = planets.Uranus;
                x[4] = planets.Neptune;
                return x;
            } else {
                planets[] x = new planets[](1);
                x[0] = planets.Earth;
                return x;
            }
        }
    }

Struct Type
___________

A struct is composite type of several other types. This is used to group related items together. before
a struct can be used, the struct must be defined. Then the name of the struct can then be used as a
type itself. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract deck {
      enum suit { club, diamonds, hearts, spades }
      enum value { two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, king, ace }
      struct card {
          value v;
          suit s;
      }

      function score(card c) public returns (uint32 score) {
          if (c.s == suit.hearts) {
              if (c.v == value.ace) {
                  score = 14;
              }
              if (c.v == value.king) {
                  score = 13;
              }
              if (c.v == value.queen) {
                  score = 12;
              }
              if (c.v == value.jack) {
                  score = 11;
              }
          }
          // all others score 0
      }
  }

A struct has one or more fields, each with a unique name. Structs can be function arguments and return
values. Structs can contain other structs. There is a struct literal syntax to create a struct with
all the fields set.

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract deck {
      enum suit { club, diamonds, hearts, spades }
      enum value { two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, king, ace }
      struct card {
          value v;
          suit s;
      }

      card card1 = card(value.two, suit.club);
      card card2 = card({s: suit.club, v: value.two});

      // This function does a lot of copying
      function set_card1(card c) public returns (card previous) {
          previous = card1;
          card1 = c;
      }
  }

The two contract storage variables ``card1`` and ``card2`` have initializers using struct literals. Struct
literals can either set fields by their position, or field name. In either syntax, all the fields must
be specified. When specifying structs fields by position, it is more likely that the wrong field gets
set to the wrong value. In the example of the card, if the order is wrong then the compiler will give
an errors because the field type does no match; setting a ``suit`` enum field with ``value`` enum
is not permitted. However, if both fields were the of the same type, then the compiler would have no
way of knowing if the fields are in the intended order.

Struct definitions from other contracts can be used, by referring to them with the `contractname.`
prefix. Struct definitions can appear outside of contract definitions, in which case they can be used
in any contract without the prefix.

.. code-block:: javascript

    struct user {
        string name;
        bool active;
    }

    contract auth {
        function authenticate(string name, db.users storage users) public returns (bool) {
            // ...
        }
    }

    contract db {
        struct users {
            user[] field1;
            int32 count;
        }
    }

The `users` struct contains an array of `user`, which is another struct. The `users` struct is
defined in contract `db`, and can be used in another contract with the type name `db.users`. Astute
readers may have noticed that the `db.users` struct is used before it is declared. In Solidity,
types can be always be used before their declaration.

Structs can be contract storage variables. Structs in contract storage can be assigned to structs
in memory and vice versa, like in the *set_card1()* function. Copying structs between storage
and memory is expensive; code has to be generated for each field and executed.

- The function argument ``c`` has to ABI decoded (1 copy + decoding overhead)
- The ``card1`` has to load from contract storage (1 copy + contract storage overhead)
- The ``c`` has to be stored into contract storage (1 copy + contract storage overhead)
- The ``pervious`` struct has to ABI encoded (1 copy + encoding overhead)

Note that struct variables are references. When contract struct variables or normal struct variables
are passed around, just the memory address or storage slot is passed around internally. This makes
it very cheap, but it does mean that if the called function modifies the struct, then this is
visible in the callee as well.

.. code-block:: javascript

  context foo {
      struct bar {
          bytes32 f1;
          bytes32 f2;
          bytes32 f3;
          bytes32 f4;
      }

      function f(struct bar b) public {
          b.f4 = hex"foobar";
      }

      function example() public {
          bar bar1;

          // bar1 is passed by reference; just its address is passed
          f(bar1);

          assert(bar.f4 == hex"foobar");
      }
  }

.. note::

  In the Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler, you need to add ``pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;``
  to use structs as return values or function arguments in public functions. The default ABI encoder
  of Solang can handle structs, so there is no need for this pragma. The Solang compiler ignores
  this pragma if present.

Fixed Length Arrays
___________________

Arrays can be declared by adding [length] to the type name, where length is a
constant expression. Any type can be made into an array, including arrays themselves (also
known as arrays of arrays). For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract foo {
        /// In a vote with 11 voters, do the ayes have it?
        function f(bool[11] votes) public pure returns (bool) {
            uint32 i;
            uint32 ayes = 0;

            for (i=0; i<votes.length; i++) {
                if (votes[i]) {
                    ayes += 1;
                }
            }

            // votes.length is odd; integer truncation means that 11 / 2 = 5
            return ayes > votes.length / 2;
        }
    }

Note the length of the array can be read with the ``.length`` member. The length is readonly.
Arrays can be initialized with an array literal. The first element of the array should be
cast to the correct element type. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract primes {
        uint64[10] constant primes = [ uint64(2), 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 ];

        function primenumber(uint32 n) public pure returns (uint64) {
            return primes[n];
        }
    }

Any array subscript which is out of bounds (either an negative array index, or an index past the
last element) will cause a runtime exception. In this example, calling ``primenumber(10)`` will
fail; the first prime number is indexed by 0, and the last by 9.

Arrays are passed by reference. This means that if you modify the array in another function,
those changes will be reflected in the current function. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract reference {
        function set_2(int8[4] a) pure private {
            a[2] = 102;
        }

        function foo() private {
            int8[4] val = [ int8(1), 2, 3, 4 ];

            set_2(val);

            // val was passed by reference, so was modified
            assert(val[2] == 102);
        }
    }

.. note::

  In Solidity, an fixed array of 32 bytes (or smaller) can be declared as ``bytes32`` or
  ``int8[32]``. In the Ethereum ABI encoding, an ``int8[32]`` is encoded using
  32 × 32 = 1024 bytes. This is because the Ethereum ABI encoding pads each primitive to
  32 bytes. However, since ``bytes32`` is a primitive in itself, this will only be 32
  bytes when ABI encoded.

  In Substrate, the `SCALE <https://substrate.dev/docs/en/overview/low-level-data-format>`_
  encoding uses 32 bytes for both types.

Dynamic Length Arrays
_____________________

Dynamic length arrays are useful for when you do not know in advance how long your arrays
will need to be. They are declared by adding ``[]`` to your type. How they can be used depends
on whether they are contract storage variables or stored in memory.

Memory dynamic arrays must be allocated with ``new`` before they can be used. The ``new``
expression requires a single unsigned integer argument. The length can be read using
``length`` member variable. Once created, the length of the array cannot be changed.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract dynamicarray {
        function test(uint32 size) public {
            int64[] memory a = new int64[](size);

            for (uint32 i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                a[i] = 1 << i;
            }

            assert(a.length == size);
        }
    }


.. note::

    There is a `bounty available <https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang/issues/177>`_
    to make memory arrays have push() and pop() functions.

Storage dynamic memory arrays do not have to be allocated. By default, the have a
length of zero and elements can be added and removed using the ``push()`` and ``pop()``
methods.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract s {
        int64[] a;

        function test() public {
            // push takes a single argument with the item to be added
            a.push(128);
            // push with no arguments adds 0
            a.push();
            // now we have two elements in our array, 128 and 0
            assert(a.length == 2);
            a[0] |= 64;
            // pop removes the last element
            a.pop();
            // you can assign the return value of pop
            int64 v = a.pop();
            assert(v == 192);
        }
    }

Calling the method ``pop()`` on an empty array is an error and contract execution will abort,
just like when you access an element beyond the end of an array.

``push()`` without any arguments return a storage reference. This is only available for types
that support storage references (see below).

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract example {
        struct user {
            address who;
            uint32 hitcount;
        }
        s[] foo;

        function test() public {
            // foo.push() creates an empty entry and returns a reference to it
            user storage x = foo.push();

            x.who = address(1);
            x.hitcount = 1;
        }
    }

Depending on the array element, ``pop()`` can be costly. It has to first copy the element to
memory, and then clear storage.

String
______

Strings can be initialized with a string literal or a hex literal. Strings can be
concatenated and compared; no other operations are allowed on them.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract example {
        function test(string s) public returns (bool) {
            string str = "Hello, " + s + "!";

            return (str == "Hello, World!");
        }
    }

Strings can be cast to `bytes`. This cast has no runtime cost, since both types use
the same underlying data structure.

Dynamic Length Bytes
____________________

The ``bytes`` datatype is a dynamic length array of bytes. It can be created with
the ``new`` operator, or from an string or hex initializer.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract b {
        function test() public {
            bytes a = hex"0000_00fa";
            bytes b = new bytes(4);

            b[3] = hex"fa";

            assert(a == b);
        }
    }

If the ``bytes`` variable is a storage variable, there is a ``push()`` and ``pop()``
method available to add and remove bytes from the array. Array elements in a
memory ``bytes`` can be modified, but no elements can be removed or added, in other
words, ``push()`` and ``pop()`` are not available when ``bytes`` is stored in memory.

A ``string`` type can be cast to ``bytes``. This way, the string can be modified or
characters can be read. Note this will access the string by byte, not character, so
any non-ascii characters will need special handling.

An dynamic array of bytes can use the type ``bytes`` or ``byte[]``. The latter
stores each byte in an individual storage slot, while the former stores the
entire string in a single storage slot, when possible. Additionally a ``string``
can be cast to ``bytes`` but not to ``byte[]``.

Mappings
________

Mappings are a dictionary type, or a hashmap. Mappings have a number of
limitations:

- it has to have to be in contract storage, not memory
- they are not iterable
- the key cannot be a ``struct``, array, or another mapping.

Mappings are declared with ``mapping(keytype => valuetype)``, for example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract b {
        struct user {
            bool exists;
            address addr;
        }
        mapping(string => user) users;

        function add(string name, address addr) public {
            // assigning to a storage variable creates a reference
            user storage s = users[name];

            s.exists = true;
            s.addr = addr;
        }

        function get(string name) public view returns (bool, address) {
            // assigning to a memory variable creates a copy
            user s = users[name];

            return (s.exists, s.addr);
        }

        function rm(string name) public {
            delete users[name];
        }
    }

.. tip::

  When assigning multiple members in a struct in a mapping, it is better to create
  a storage variable as a reference to the struct, and then assign to the reference.
  The add() function above could have been written as:

  .. code-block:: javascript

    function add(string name, address addr) public {
        s[name].exists = true;
        s[name].addr = addr;
    }

  Here the storage slot for struct is calculated twice, which includes an expensive
  keccak256 calculation.

If you access a non-existing field on a mapping, all the fields will read as zero. So, it
is common practise to have a boolean field called ``exists``. Since mappings are not iterable,
it is not possible to do a ``delete`` on an mapping, but an entry can be deleted.

.. note::

  Solidity takes the keccak 256 hash of the key and the storage slot, and simply uses that
  to find the entry. There are no hash collision chains. This scheme is simple and avoids
  `"hash flooding" <https://www.securityweek.com/hash-table-collision-attacks-could-trigger-ddos-massive-scale>`_
  attacks where the attacker chooses data which hashes to the same hash
  collision chain, making the hash table very slow; it will behave like a linked list.

  In order to implement mappings in memory, a new scheme must be found which avoids this
  attack. Usually this is done with `SipHash <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash>`_, but
  this cannot be used in smart contracts since there is no place to store secrets. Collision
  chains are needed since memory has a much smaller address space than the 256 bit storage
  slots.

  Any suggestions for solving this are very welcome!

Contract Types
______________

In Solidity, other smart contracts can be called and created. So, there is a type to hold the
address of a contract. This is in fact simply the address of the contract, with some syntax
sugar for calling functions on the contract.

A contract can be created with the new statment, followed by the name of the contract. The
arguments to the constructor must be provided.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract child {
        function announce() public {
            print("Greetings from child contract");
        }
    }

    contract creator {
        function test() public {
            child c = new child();

            c.announce();
        }
    }

Since child does not have a constructor, no arguments are needed for the new statement. The variable
`c` of the contract `child` type, which simply holds its address. Functions can be called on
this type. The contract type can be cast to and from address, provided an explicit cast is used.

The expression ``this`` evaluates to the current contract, which can be cast to ``address`` or 
``address payable``.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract example {
        function get_address() public returns (address) {
            return address(this);
        }
    }

Storage References
__________________

Parameters, return types, and variables can be declared storage references by adding
``storage`` after the type name. This means that the variable holds a references to a
particular contract storage variable.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract felix {
        enum Felines { None, Lynx, Felis, Puma, Catopuma };
        Felines[100] group_a;
        Felines[100] group_b;


        function count_pumas(Felines[100] storage cats) private returns (uint32)
    {
            uint32 count = 0;
            uint32 i = 0;

            for (i = 0; i < cats.length; i++) {
                if (cats[i] == Felines.Puma) {
                    ++count;
                }
            }

            return count;
        }

        function all_pumas() public returns (uint32) {
            Felines[100] storage ref = group_a;

            uint32 total = count_pumas(ref);

            ref = group_b;

            total += count_pumas(ref);

            return total;
        }
    }

Functions which have either storage parameter or return types cannot be public; when a function
is called via the ABI encoder/decoder, it is not possible to pass references, just values.
However it is possible to use storage reference variables in public functions, as
demonstrated in function all_pumas().

Expressions
-----------

Solidity resembles the C family of languages. Expressions can have the following operators.

Arithmetic operators
____________________

The binary operators ``-``, ``+``, ``*``, ``/``, ``%``, and ``**`` are supported, and also
in the assignment form ``-=``, ``+=``, ``*=``, ``/=``, and ``%=``. There is a
unary operator ``-``.

.. code-block:: javascript

 	uint32 fahrenheit = celcius * 9 / 5 + 32;

Parentheses can be used too, of course:

.. code-block:: javascript

 	uint32 celcius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;

The assignment operator:

.. code-block:: javascript

 	balance += 10;

The exponation (or power) can be used to multiply a number N times by itself, i.e.
x :superscript:`y`. This can only be done for unsigned types.

.. code-block:: javascript

  uint64 thousand = 1000;
  uint64 billion = thousand ** 3;

.. note::

  No overflow checking is done on the arithmetic operations, just like with the
  Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler.

Bitwise operators
_________________

The ``|``, ``&``, ``^`` are supported, as are the shift operators ``<<``
and ``>>``. There are also available in the assignment form ``|=``, ``&=``,
``^=``, ``<<=``, and ``>>=``. Lastly there is a unary operator ``~`` to
invert all the bits in a value.

Logical operators
_________________

The logical operators ``||``, ``&&``, and ``!`` are supported. The ``||`` and ``&&``
short-circuit. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

  bool foo = x > 0 || bar();

bar() will not be called if the left hand expression evaluates to true, i.e. x is greater
than 0. If x is 0, then bar() will be called and the result of the ``||`` will be
the return value of bar(). Similarly, the right hand expressions of ``&&`` will not be
evaluated if the left hand expression evaluates to ``false``; in this case, whatever
ever the outcome of the right hand expression, the ``&&`` will result in ``false``.


.. code-block:: javascript

  bool foo = x > 0 && bar();

Now ``bar()`` will only be called if x *is* greater than 0. If x is 0 then the ``&&``
will result in false, irrespective of what bar() would returns, so bar() is not
called at all. The expression elides execution of the right hand side, which is also
called *short-circuit*.


Ternary operator
________________

The ternary operator ``? :`` is supported:

.. code-block:: javascript

  uint64 abs = foo > 0 ? foo : -foo;


Comparison operators
____________________

It is also possible to compare values. For, this the ``>=``, ``>``, ``==``, ``!=``, ``<``, and ``<=``
is supported. This is useful for conditionals.


The result of a comparison operator can be assigned to a bool. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

 	bool even = (value % 2) == 0;

It is not allowed to assign an integer to a bool; an explicit comparision is needed to turn it into
a bool.

Increment and Decrement operators
_________________________________

The post-increment and pre-increment operators are implemented like you would expect. So, ``a++``
evaluates to the value of of ``a`` before incrementing, and ``++a`` evaluates to value of ``a``
after incrementing.

this
____

The keyword ``this`` evaluates to the current contract. The type of this is the type of the
current contract. It can be cast to ``address`` or ``address payable`` using a cast.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract kadowari {
        function nomi() public {
            kadowari c = this;
            address a = address(c);
        }
    }

Casting
_______

Solidity is very strict about the sign of operations, and whether an assignment can truncate a
value. You can force the compiler to accept truncations or differences in sign by adding a cast,
but this is best avoided. Often changing the parameters or return value of a function will avoid
the need for casting.

Some examples:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function abs(int bar) public returns (int64) {
      if (bar > 0) {
          return bar;
      } else {
          return -bar;
      }
  }

The compiler will say:

.. code-block:: none

   implicit conversion would truncate from int256 to int64

Now you can work around this by adding a cast to the argument to return ``return int64(bar);``,
however it would be much nicer if the return value matched the argument. Multiple abs() could exists
with overloaded functions, so that there is an ``abs()`` for each type.

It is allowed to cast from a ``bytes`` type to ``int`` or ``uint`` (or vice versa), only if the length
of the type is the same. This requires an explicit cast.

.. code-block:: javascript

  bytes4 selector = "ABCD";
  uint32 selector_as_uint = uint32(selector);

If the length also needs to change, then another cast is needed to adjust the length. Truncation and
extension is different for integers and bytes types. Integers pad zeros on the left when extending,
and truncate on the right. bytes pad on right when extending, and truncate on the left. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

  bytes4 start = "ABCD";
  uint64 start1 = uint64(uint4(start));
  // first cast to int, then extend as int: start1 = 0x41424344
  uint64 start2 = uint64(bytes8(start));
  // first extend as bytes, then cast to int: start2 = 0x4142434400000000

A similar example for truncation:

.. code-block:: javascript

  uint64 start = 0xdead_cafe;
  bytes4 start1 = bytes4(uint32(start));
  // first truncate as int, then cast: start1 = hex"cafe"
  bytes4 start2 = bytes4(bytes8(start));
  // first cast, then truncate as bytes: start2 = hex"dead"

Since ``byte`` is array of one byte, a conversion from ``byte`` to ``uint8`` requires a cast.

Contract Storage
----------------

Any variables declared at the contract level (so not declared in a function or constructor),
will automatically become contract storage. Contract storage is maintained on chain, so they
retain their values between calls. These are declared so:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract hitcount {
      uint counter = 1;

      function hit() public {
          counters++;
      }

      function count() public view returns (uint) {
          return counter;
      }
  }

The ``counter`` is maintained for each deployed ``hitcount`` contract. When the contract is deployed,
the contract storage is set to 1. The ``= 1`` initializer is not required; when it is not present, it
is initialized to 0, or ``false`` if it is a ``bool``.

How to clear Contract Storage
_____________________________

Any contract storage variable can have its underlying contract storage cleared with the ``delete``
operator. This can be done on any type; a simple integer, an array element, or the entire
array itself. Note this can be costly.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract s {
        struct user {
            address f1;
            int[] list;
        }
        user[1000] users;

        function clear() public {
            // delete has to iterate over 1000 users, and for each of those clear the
            // f1 field, read the length of the list, and iterate over each of those
            delete users;
        }
    }

Constants
---------

Constants are declared at the contract level just like contract storage variables. However, they
do not use any contract storage and cannot be modified. Assigning a value to a constant is a
compiler error. The variable must have an initializer, which must be a constant expression. It is
not allowed to call functions or read variables in the initializer:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract ethereum {
      uint constant byzantium_block = 4_370_000;
  }

Constructors and contract instantiation
---------------------------------------

When a contract is deployed, the contract storage is initialized to the initializer values provided,
and any constructor is called. A constructor is not required for a contract. A constructor is defined
like so:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract mycontract {
      uint foo;

      constructor(uint foo_value) public {
          foo = foo_value;
      }
  }

A constructor does not have a name and may have any number of arguments. If a constructor has arguments,
then when the contract is deployed then those arguments must be supplied.

A constructor must be declared ``public``.

.. note::

  Parity Substrate allows multiple constructors to be defined, which is not true for
  ewasm. So, when building for Substrate, multiple constructors can be
  defined as long as their argument list is different (i.e. overloaded).

  When the contract is deployed in the Polkadot UI, the user can select the constructor to be used.

.. note::

  The Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler allows constructors to be declared ``internal`` if
  for abstract contracts. Since Solang does not support abstract contracts, this is not possible yet.

Instantiation using new
_______________________

Contracts can be created using the ``new`` keyword. The contract that is being created might have
constructor arguments, which need to be provided.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contact hatchling {
        string name;

        constructor(string id) public {
            require(id != "", "name must be provided");
            name = id;
        }
    }

    contract adult {
        function test() public {
            hatchling h = new hatchling("luna");
        }
    }

The constructor might fail for various reasons, for example `require()` might fail here. This can
be handled using the :ref:`try-catch` statement, else errors are passed on the caller.

Functions
---------

Functions can be declared and called as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contact foo {
      uint bound = get_initial_bound();

      /// get_initial_bound is called from the constructor
      function get_initial_bound() private returns (uint value) {
          value = 102;
      }

      /** set bound for get with bound */
      function set_bound(uint _bound) public {
          bound = _bound;
      }

      /// Clamp a value within a bound.
      /// The bound can be set with set_bound().
      function get_with_bound(uint value) view public return (uint) {
          if (value < bound) {
              return value;
          } else {
              return bound;
          }
      }
  }

Function can have any number of arguments. Function arguments may have names;
if they do not have names then they cannot be used in the function body, but they will
be present in the public interface.

The return values may have names as demonstrated in the get_initial_bound() function.
When at least one of the return values has a name, then the return statement is no
longer required at the end of a function body. In stead of returning the values
which are provided in the return statement, the values of the return variables at the end
of the function is returned. It is still possible to explicitly return some values
with a return statement with some values.

Functions which are declared ``public`` will be present in the ABI and are callable
externally. If a function is declared ``private`` then it is not callable externally,
but it can be called from within the contract.

Any DocComment before a function will be include in the ABI. Currently only Substrate
supports documentation in the ABI.

Calling Functions
_________________

Function arguments can be passed either by position or by name. When they are called
by name, arguments can be in any order. However, functions with anonymous arguments
(arguments without name) cannot be called this way.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract foo {
        function bar(uint32 x, bool y) public {
            // ...
        }

        function test() public {
            bar(102, false);
            bar({ y: true, x: 302 });
        }
    }

If the function has a single return value, this can be assigned to a variable. If
the function has multiple return values, these can be assigned using the :ref:`destructuring`
assignment statement:

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract foo {
        function bar1(uint32 x, bool y) public returns (address, byte32) {
            return (address(3), hex"01020304");
        }

        function bar2(uint32 x, bool y) public returns (bool) {
            return !y;
        }

        function test() public {
            (address f1, bytes32 f2) = bar1(102, false);
            bool f3 = bar2({x: 255, y: true})
        }
    }

It is also possible to call functions on other contracts, which is also known as calling
external functions. The called function must be declared public, else the call will fail.
Calling external functions requires ABI encoding the arguments, and ABI decoding the
return values. This much more costly than an internal function call.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract foo {
        function bar1(uint32 x, bool y) public returns (address, byte32) {
            return (address(3), hex"01020304");
        }

        function bar2(uint32 x, bool y) public returns (bool) {
            return !y;
        }
    }

    contract bar {
        function test(foo f) public {
            (address f1, bytes32 f2) = f.bar1(102, false);
            bool f3 = f.bar2({x: 255, y: true})
        }
    }

The syntax for calling external call is the same as the external call, except for
that it must be done on a contract type variable. Any error in an external call can
be handled with :ref:`try-catch`.

Function overloading
____________________

Multiple functions with the same name can be declared, as long as the arguments are
different in at least one of two ways:

- The number of arguments must be different
- The type of at least one of the arguments is different

A function cannot be overloaded by changing the return types or number of returned
values. Here is an example of an overloaded function:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract shape {
      int64 bar;

      function abs(int val) public returns (int) {
          if (val >= 0) {
              return val;
          } else {
              return -val;
          }
      }

      function abs(int64 val) public returns (int64) {
          if (val >= 0) {
              return val;
          } else {
              return -val;
          }
      }

      function foo(int64 x) public {
          bar = abs(x);
      }
  }

In the function foo, abs() is called with an ``int64`` so the second implementation
of the function abs() is called.

Function Mutability
___________________

A function which does not access any contract storage, can be declared ``pure``.
Alternatively, if a function only reads contract, but does not write to contract
storage, it can be declared ``view``.

When a function is declared either ``view`` or ``pure``, it can be called without
creating an on-chain transaction, so there is no associated gas cost.

Fallback function
_________________

When a function is called externally, either via an transaction or when one contract
call a function on another contract, the correct function is dispatched based on the
function selector in the raw encoded ABI call data. If no function matches, then the
fallback function is called, if it is defined. If no fallback function is defined then
the call aborts via the ``unreachable`` wasm instruction. A fallback function may not have a name,
any arguments or return values, and must be declared ``external``. Here is an example of
fallback function:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract test {
      int32 bar;

      function foo(uint32 x) public {
          bar = x;
      }

      function() external {
          bar = 0;
      }
  }

Statements
----------

In functions, you can declare variables with the types or an enum. If the name is the same as
an existing function, enum type, or another variable, then the compiler will generate a
warning as the original item is no longer accessible.

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract test {
      uint foo = 102;
      uint bar;

      function foobar() private {
          // AVOID: this shadows the contract storage variable foo
          uint foo = 5;
      }
  }

Scoping rules apply as you would expect, so if you declare a variable in a block, then it is not
accessible outside that block. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   function foo() public {
      // new block is introduced with { and ends with }
      {
          uint a;

          a = 102;
      }

      // ERROR: a is out of scope
      uint b = a + 5;
  }

If statement
____________

Conditional execution of a block can be achieved using an ``if (condition) { }`` statement. The
condition must evaluate to a ``bool`` value.

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo(uint32 n) private {
      if (n > 10) {
          // do something
      }

      // ERROR: unlike C integers can not be used as a condition
      if (n) {
            // ...
      }
  }

The statements enclosed by ``{`` and ``}`` (commonly known as a *block*) are executed only if
the condition evaluates to true.

While statement
_______________

Repeated execution of a block can be achieved using ``while``. It syntax is similar to ``if``,
however the block is repeatedly executed until the condition evaluates to false.
If the condition is not true on first execution, then the loop is never executed:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo(uint n) private {
      while (n >= 10) {
          n -= 9;
      }
  }

It is possible to terminate execution of the while statement by using the ``break`` statement.
Execution will continue to next statement in the function. Alternatively, ``continue`` will
cease execution of the block, but repeat the loop if the condition still holds:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo(uint n) private {
      while (n >= 10) {
          n--;

          if (n >= 100) {
              // do not execute the if statement below, but loop again
              continue;
          }

          if (bar(n)) {
              // cease execution of this while loop and jump to the "n = 102" statement
              break;
          }
      }

      n = 102;
  }

Do While statement
__________________

A ``do { ... } while (condition);`` statement is much like the ``while (condition) { ... }`` except
that the condition is evaluated after execution the block. This means that the block is executed
at least once, which is not true for ``while`` statements:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo(uint n) private {
      do {
          n--;

          if (n >= 100) {
              // do not execute the if statement below, but loop again
              continue;
          }

          if (bar(n)) {
              // cease execution of this while loop and jump to the "n = 102" statement
              break;
          }
      }
      while (n > 10);

      n = 102;
  }

For statements
______________

For loops are like ``while`` loops with added syntaxic sugar. To execute a loop, we often
need to declare a loop variable, set its initial variable, have a loop condition, and then
adjust the loop variable for the next loop iteration.

For example, to loop from 0 to 1000 by steps of 100:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo() private {
      for (uint i = 0; i <= 1000; i += 100) {
          // ...
      }
  }

The declaration ``uint i = 0`` can be omitted if no new variable needs to be declared, and
similarly the post increment ``i += 100`` can be omitted if not necessary. The loop condition
must evaluate to a boolean, or it can be omitted completely. If it is ommited the block must
contain a ``break`` or ``return`` statement, else execution will
repeat infinitely (or until all gas is spent):

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo(uint n) private {
      // all three omitted
      for (;;) {
          // there must be a way out
          if (n == 0) {
              break;
          }
      }
  }

.. _destructuring:

Destructuring Statement
_______________________

The destructuring statement can be used for making function calls to functions that have
multiple return values. The list can contain either:

1. The name of an existing variable. The type must match the type of the return value.
2. A variable declaration with a type. The type must match the type of the return value.
3. Empty; this return value is not used or accessible.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract destructure {
        function func() internal returns (bool, int32, string) {
            return (true, 5, "abcd")
        }

        function test() public {
            string s;
            (bool b, _, s) = func();
        }
    }

The right hand side may also be a list of expressions. This type can be useful for swapping
values, for example.

.. code-block:: javascript

    function test() public {
        (int32 a, int32 b, int32 c) = (1, 2, 3);

        (b, , a) = (a, 5, b);
    }

.. _try-catch:

Try Catch Statement
___________________

Sometimes execution gets reverted due to a ``revert()`` or ``require()``. These types of problems
usually cause the entire chain of execution to be aborted. However, it is possible to catch
some of these problems and continue execution.

This is only possible for contract instantiation through new, and external function calls.
Internal function call cannot be handing this way. Not all problems can be handled either,
for example, out of gas cannot be caught. The ``revert()`` and ``require()`` builtins may
be passed a reason code, which can be inspected using the ``catch Error(string)`` syntax.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract aborting {
        constructor() public {
            revert("bar");
        }
    }

    contract runner {
        function test() public {
            try new aborting() returns (aborting a) {
                // new succeeded; a holds the a reference to the new contract
            }
            catch Error(string x) {
                if (x == "bar") {
                    // "bar" revert or require was executed
                }
            }
            catch (bytes raw) {
                // if no error string could decoding, we end up here with the raw data
            }
        }
    }

The same statement can be used for calling external functions. The ``returns (...)``
part must match the return types for the function. If no name is provided, that
return value is not accessible.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract aborting {
        function abort() public returns (int32, bool) {
            revert("bar");
        }
    }

    contract runner {
        function test() public {
            aborting abort = new aborting();

            try new abort.abort() returns (int32 a, bool b) {
                // call succeeded; return values are in a and b
            }
            catch Error(string x) {
                if (x == "bar") {
                    // "bar" reason code was provided through revert() or require()
                }
            }
            catch (bytes raw) {
                // if no error string could decoding, we end up here with the raw data
            }
        }
    }

There is an alternate syntax which avoids the abi decoding by leaving that part out. This
might be useful when no error string is expected, and will generate shorter code.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract aborting {
        function abort() public returns (int32, bool) {
            revert("bar");
        }
    }

    contract runner {
        function test() public {
            aborting abort = new aborting();

            try new abort.abort() returns (int32 a, bool b) {
                // call succeeded; return values are in a and b
            }
            catch (bytes raw) {
                // call failed with raw error in raw
            }
        }
    }

Builtin Functions
-----------------

assert(bool)
____________

Assert takes a boolean argument. If that evaluates to false, execution is aborted.


.. code-block:: javascript

    contract c {
        constructor(int x) public {
            assert(x > 0);
        }
    }

print(string)
_____________

print() takes a string argument.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract c {
        constructor() public {
            print("Hello, world!");
        }
    }

.. note::

  print() is not available with the Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler.

  When using Substrate, this function is only available on development chains.
  If you use this functio on a production chain, the contract will fail to load.

  When using ewasm, the function is only available on hera when compiled with
  debugging.

revert() or revert(string)
__________________________

revert aborts execution of the current contract, and returns to the caller. revert()
can be called with no arguments, or a single `string` argument, which is called the
`ReasonCode`. This function can be called at any point, either in a constructor or
a function.

If the caller is another contract, it can use the `ReasonCode` in a :ref:`try-catch`
statement.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract x {
        constructor(address foobar) public {
            if (a == address(0)) {
                revert("foobar must a valid address");
            }
        }
    }

require(bool) or require(bool, string)
______________________________________

This function is used to check that a condition holds true, or abort execution otherwise. So,
if the first `bool` argument is `true`, this function does nothing, however
if the `bool` arguments is `false`, then execution is aborted. There is an optional second
`string` argument which is called the `ReasonCode`, which can be used by the caller
to identify what the problem is.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract x {
        constructor(address foobar) public {
            require(foobar != address(0), ,"foobar must a valid address");
        }
    }

selfdestruct(address payable recipient)
_______________________________________

The `selfdestruct()` function causes the current contract to be deleted, and any remaining
balance to be sent to `recipient`. This functions does not return, as the contract no
longer exists.
