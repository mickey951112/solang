Solidity Language
=================

The Solidity language support by Solang is compatible with the
`Ethereum Foundation Solidity Compiler <https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/>`_ with
these caveats:

- At this point Solang is very much a work in progress; not at all features
  are supported yet.

- Solang can target different blockchains and some features depending on the target.
  For example, Parity Substrate uses a different ABI encoding and allows constructors
  to be overloaded.

- Solang generates WebAssembly rather than EVM. This means that the ``assembly {}``
  using EVM instructions is not supported.

.. note::

  Where differences exist between different targets or the Ethereum Foundation Solidity
  compiler, this is noted in boxes like these.

Solidity Source File Structure
------------------------------

A solidity file may have multiple contracts in them. If you compile a Solidity file containing:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract A {
      function foo() public return (bool) {
          return true;
      }
  }

  contract B {
      function bar() public return (bool) {
          return false;
      }
  }

Then Solang will output ``A.wasm`` and ``B.wasm``, along with the ABI files for each contract.

.. note::

  The Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler can also contain other other elements other than
  contracts: ``pragma``, ``import``, ``library``, ``interface``. These are not supported yet
  and these should not be included as they may result in parser errors.

Types
-----

The following primitive types are supported:

``bool``
  This represents a single value which can be either ``true`` or ``false``

``uint``
  This represents a single unsigned integer of 256 bits wide. Values can be for example
  ``0``, ``102``, ``0xdeadcafe``, or ``1000_000_000_000_000``.

``uint64``, ``uint32``, ``uint16``, ``uint8``
  These represent shorter single unsigned integers of the given width. These widths are
  most efficient in WebAssembly and should be used whenever possible.

``uintN``
  These represent shorter single unsigned integers of width ``N``. ``N`` can be anything
  between 8 and 256 bits.

``int``
  This represents a single signed integer of 256 bits wide. Values can be for example
  ``-102``, ``0``, ``102`` or ``-0xdead_cafe``.

``int64``, ``uint32``, ``uint16``, ``uint8``
  These represent shorter single signed integers of the given width. These widths are
  most efficient in WebAssembly and should be used whenever possible.

``intN``
  These represent shorter single signed integers of width ``N``. ``N`` can be anything
  between 8 and 256 bits.

Underscores ``_`` are allowed in numbers, as long as the number does not start with
an underscore. This means that ``1_000`` is allowed but ``_1000`` is not. Similarly
``0xffff_0000`` is fine, but ``0x_f`` is not.

Assigning values which cannot fit into the type gives a compiler error. For example::

    uint8 foo = 300;

The largest value an ``uint8`` can hold is (2^8) - 1 = 255. So, the compiler says::

    implicit conversion would truncate from uint16 to uint8

.. note::

  The Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler supports additional data types: address,
  bytes and string. These will be implemented in Solang in early 2020.

.. tip::

  When using integers, whenever possible use the ``int64``, ``int32`` or ``uint64``,
  ``uint32`` types.

  The Solidity language has its origins in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which has
  support for 256 bit registers. Most common CPUs like x86_64 do not implement arithmetic
  for such large types, and the EVM virtual machine itself has to do bigint calculations, which
  are costly. This means that EVM instructions with gas cost of 1 can be very expensive in
  real CPU cost.

  WebAssembly does not support this. This means that Solang has to emulate larger types with
  multiple WebAssembly instructions, resulting in larger contract code and higher gas cost.
  As a result, gas cost approximates real CPU cost much better.

Expressions
-----------

Solidity resembles the C family of languages, however it has its quirks. Expressions
can have the following operators.

Arithmetic operators
____________________

The binary operators ``-``, ``+``, ``*``, ``/``, ``%``, and ``**`` are supported, and also
in the assignment form ``-=``, ``+=``, ``*=``, ``/=``, and ``%=``. There is a
unary operator ``-``.

.. code-block:: javascript

 	uint32 fahrenheit = celcius * 9 / 5 + 32;

Parentheses can be used too, of course:

.. code-block:: javascript

 	uint32 celcius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;

The assignment operator:

.. code-block:: javascript

 	balance += 10;

The exponation (or power) can be used to multiply a number N times by itself. This can only be done
for unsigned types.

.. code-block:: javascript

  uint64 thousand = 1000;
  uint64 billion = thousand ** 3;

Bitwise operators
_________________

The ``|``, ``&``, ``^`` are supported, as are the shift operators ``<<``
and ``>>``. There are also available in the assignment form ``|=``, ``&=``,
``^=``, ``<<=``, and ``>>=``. Lastly there is a unary operator ``~`` to
invert all the bits in a value.

Logical operators
_________________

The logical operators ``||``, ``&&``, and ``!`` are supported. The ``||`` and ``&&``
short-circuit. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

  bool foo = x > 0 || bar();

bar() will not be called if the left hand expression evaluates to true, i.e. x is greater
than 0. If x is 0, then bar() will be called and the result of the ``||`` will be
the return value of bar(). Similarly, the right hand expressions of ``&&`` will not be
evaluated if the left hand expression evaluates to ``false``; in this case, whatever
ever the outcome of the right hand expression, the ``&&`` will result in ``false``.


.. code-block:: javascript

  bool foo = x > 0 && bar();

Now ``bar()`` will only be called if x *is* greater than 0. If x is 0 then the ``&&``
will result in false, irrespective of what bar() would returns, so bar() is not
called at all. The expression elides execution of the right hand side, which is also
called *short-circuit*.


Ternary operator
________________

The ternary operator ``? :`` is supported:

.. code-block:: javascript

  uint64 abs = foo > 0 ? foo : -foo;


Comparison operators
____________________

It is also possible to compare values. For, this the ``>=``, ``>``, ``==``, ``!=``, ``<``, and ``<=``
is supported. This is useful for conditionals.


The result of a comparison operator can be assigned to a bool. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

 	bool even = (value % 2) == 0;

It is not allowed to assign an integer to a bool; an explicit comparision is needed to turn it into
a bool.

Increment and Decrement operators
_________________________________

The post-increment and pre-increment operators are implemented like you would expect. So, ``a++``
evaluates to the value of of ``a`` before incrementing, and ``++a`` evaluates to value of ``a``
after incrementing.

Casting
_______

Solidity is strict about the sign of operations, and whether an assignment can truncate a value;
these are fatal errors and Solang will refuse to compile it. You can force the compiler to
accept truncations or differences in sign by adding a cast, but this is best avoided. Often
changing the parameters or return value of a function will avoid the need for casting.

Some examples:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function abs(int bar) public returns (int64) {
      if (bar > 0) {
          return bar;
      } else {
          return -bar;
      }
  }

The compiler will say:

.. code-block:: none

   implicit conversion would truncate from int256 to int64

Now you can work around this by adding a cast to the argument to return ``return int64(bar);``,
however it would be much nicer if the return value matched the argument. Multiple abs() could exists
with overloaded functions, so that there is an ``abs()`` for each type.

Enums
-----

Solidity enums types have to be defined on the contract level. An enum has a type name, and a list of
unique values. Enum types can used in public functions, but the value is represented as a ``uint8``
in the ABI.

An enum can be converted to and from integer, but this requires an explicit cast. The value of an enum
is numbered from 0, like in C and Rust:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract enum_example {
      enum Weekday { Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday }

      function is_weekend(Weekday day) public pure returns (bool) {
          return (day == Weekday.Saturday || day == Weekday.Sunday);
      }
  }

Contract Storage
----------------

Any variables declared at the contract level (so not contained in a function or constructor),
then these will automatically become contract storage. Contract storage is maintained between
calls on-chain. These are declared so:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract hitcount {
      uint counter = 1;

      function hit() public {
          counters++;
      }

      function count() public returns (uint) {
          return counter;
      }
  }

The ``counter`` is maintained for each deployed ``hitcount`` contract. When the contract is deployed,
the contract storage is set to 1. The ``= 1`` initializer is not required; when it is not present, it
is initialized to 0, or ``false`` if it is a ``bool``.

Constants
---------

Constants are declared at the contract level just like contract storage variables. However, they
do not use any contract storage and cannot be modified. Assigning a value to a constant is a
compiler error. The variable must have an initializer, which must be a constant expression. It is
not allowed to call functions or read variables in the initializer:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract ethereum {
      uint constant byzantium_block = 4_370_000;
  }

Constructors
------------

When a contract is deployed, the contract storage is initialized to the initializer values provided,
and any constructor is called. A constructor is not required for a contract. A constructor is defined
like so:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract mycontract {
      uint foo;

      constructor(uint foo_value) public {
          foo = foo_value;
      }
  }

A constructor does not have a name and may have any number of arguments. If a constructor has arguments,
then when the contract is deployed then those arguments must be supplied.

A constructor must be declared ``public``.

.. note::

  Parity Substrate allows multiple constructors to be defined, which is not true for Hyperledge Burrow
  or other Ethereum Style blockchains. So, when building for Substrate, multiple constructors can be
  defined as long as their argument list is different (i.e. overloaded).

  When the contract is deployed in the Polkadot UI, the user can select the constructor to be used.

.. note::

  The Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler allows constructors to be declared ``internal`` if
  for abstract contracts. Since Solang does not support abstract contracts, this is not possible yet.

Declaring Functions
-------------------

Functions can be declared and called as follow:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contact foo {
      uint bound = get_initial_bound();

      function get_initial_bound() private returns (uint) {
          return 102;
      }

      function set_bound(uint _bound) public {
          bound = _bound;
      }

      function get_with_bound(uint value) view public return (uint) {
          if (value < bound) {
              return value;
          } else {
              return bound;
          }
      }
  }

Function can have any number of arguments. Function arguments may have names;
if they do not have names then they cannot be used in the function body, but they will
be present in the public interface. Return values cannot have names.

Functions which are declared ``public`` will be present in the ABI and are callable
externally. If a function is declared ``private`` then it is not callable externally,
but it can be called from within the contract.

.. note::

  The Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler does allow return values to have names,
  and the ``return`` statement can be elided. This will be corrected in Solang
  in early 2020.

Function overloading
____________________

Multiple functions with the same name can be declared, as long as the arguments are
different in at least one of two ways:

- The number of arguments must be different
- The type of at least one of the arguments is different

A function cannot be overloaded by changing the return types or number of returned
values. Here is an example of an overloaded function:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract shape {
      int64 bar;

      function abs(int val) public returns (int) {
          if (val >= 0) {
              return val;
          } else {
              return -val;
          }
      }

      function abs(int64 val) public returns (int64) {
          if (val >= 0) {
              return val;
          } else {
              return -val;
          }
      }

      function foo(int64 x) public {
          bar = abs(x);
      }
  }

In the function foo, abs() is called with an ``int64`` so the second implementation
of the function abs() is called.

Function Mutability
___________________

A function which does not access any contract storage, can be declared ``pure``.
Alternatively, if a function only reads contract, but does not write to contract
storage, it can be declared ``view``.

When a function is declared either ``view`` or ``pure``, it can be called without
creating an on-chain transaction, so there is no associated gas cost.

Fallback function
_________________

When a function is called externally, either via an transaction or when one contract
call a function on another contract, the correct function is dispatched based on the
function selector in the raw encoded ABI call data. If no function matches, then the
fallback function is called, if it is defined. If no fallback function is defined then
the call aborts via the ``unreachable`` wasm instruction. A fallback function may not have a name,
any arguments or return values, and must be declared ``external``. Here is an example of
fallback function:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract test {
      int32 bar;

      function foo(uint32 x) public {
          bar = x;
      }

      function() external {
          bar = 0;
      }
  }

Writing Functions
-----------------

In functions, you can declare variables with the types or an enum. If the name is the same as
an existing function, enum type, or another variable, then the compiler will generate a
warning as the original item is no longer accessible.

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract test {
      uint foo = 102;
      uint bar;

      function foobar() private {
          // AVOID: this shadows the contract storage variable foo
          uint foo = 5;
      }
  }

Scoping rules apply as you would expect, so if you declare a variable in a block, then it is not
accessible outside that block. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   function foo() public {
      // new block is introduced with { and ends with }
      {
          uint a;

          a = 102;
      }

      // ERROR: a is out of scope
      uint b = a + 5;
  }

If statement
____________

Conditional execution of a block can be achieved using an ``if (condition) { }`` statement. The
condition must evaluate to a ``bool`` value.

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo(uint32 n) private {
      if (n > 10) {
          // do something
      }

      // ERROR: unlike C integers can not be used as a condition
      if (n) {
            // ...
      }
  }

The statements enclosed by ``{`` and ``}`` (commonly known as a *block*) are executed only if
the condition evaluates to true.

While statement
_______________

Repeated execution of a block can be achieved using ``while``. It syntax is similar to ``if``,
however the block is repeatedly executed until the condition evaluates to false.
If the condition is not true on first execution, then the loop is never executed:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo(uint n) private {
      while (n >= 10) {
          n -= 9;
      }
  }

It is possible to terminate execution of the while statement by using the ``break`` statement.
Execution will continue to next statement in the function. Alternatively, ``continue`` will
cease execution of the block, but repeat the loop if the condition still holds:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo(uint n) private {
      while (n >= 10) {
          n--;

          if (n >= 100) {
              // do not execute the if statement below, but loop again
              continue;
          }

          if (bar(n)) {
              // cease execution of this while loop and jump to the "n = 102" statement
              break;
          }
      }

      n = 102;
  }

Do While statement
__________________

A ``do { ... } while (condition);`` statement is much like the ``while (condition) { ... }`` except
that the condition is evaluated after execution the block. This means that the block is executed
at least once, which is not true for ``while`` statements:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo(uint n) private {
      do {
          n--;

          if (n >= 100) {
              // do not execute the if statement below, but loop again
              continue;
          }

          if (bar(n)) {
              // cease execution of this while loop and jump to the "n = 102" statement
              break;
          }
      }
      while (n > 10);

      n = 102;
  }

For statements
______________

For loops are like ``while`` loops with added syntaxic sugar. To execute a loop, we often
need to declare a loop variable, set its initial variable, have a loop condition, and then
adjust the loop variable for the next loop iteration.

For example, to loop from 0 to 1000 by steps of 100:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo() private {
      for (uint i = 0; i <= 1000; i += 100) {
          // ...
      }
  }

The declaration ``uint i = 0`` can be omitted if no new variable needs to be declared, and
similarly the post increment ``i += 100`` can be omitted if not necessary. The loop condition
must evaluate to a boolean, or it can be omitted completely. If it is ommited the block must
contain a ``break`` or ``return`` statement, else execution will
repeat infinitely (or until all gas is spent):

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo(uint n) private {
      // all three omitted
      for (;;) {
          // there must be a way out
          if (n == 0) {
              break;
          }
      }
  }
