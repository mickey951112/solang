Welcome to solang, a new Solidity compiler written in rust which uses
llvm as the compiler backend. As a result, only the compiler front end
needs to be written in rust.

solang is under active development right now, and should be documented as
the same time as the implementation. Please have a look at
[our documentation](https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
